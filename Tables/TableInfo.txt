Each entity (model) requires a set of tables;
	Instance
	Category
	Attributes

Create using SQL statements.

Category & Attributes tables = standard link tables where each category 
can have many other categories and many custom attributes.

Catergory names are UNIQUE.

Product names are not required to be UNIQUE.

SQL Server will reject categories if you try to create one with a previously used name.

UDTT - Allows for users to upload data to CategoryCollection & CustomAttributes
